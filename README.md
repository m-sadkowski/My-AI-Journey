# AI Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **AI Learning Journey** repository! This is where I document my exploration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. Most of the code here is written in **Python**, as I dive into the fascinating world of AI, experiment with algorithms, and build small projects to solidify my understanding.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the code. If you find anything helpful or have suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!
